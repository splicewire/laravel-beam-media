/**
 * The spatie/laravel-medialibrary `media` table — owned by beam-media (extracted from beam-core, HTTP-03 /
 * ADR-0178) rather than published verbatim from spatie's stub, so the polymorphic `model_id` is a UUID.
 * Shipped as a publish-only migration (like the beam substrate tables): the package ships this
 * real-timestamped copy and publishes it VERBATIM into the host via native `publishesMigrations`
 * (`vendor:publish --tag=beam-media-migrations`) — beam-media never loadMigrationsFrom's it at runtime —
 * and the HOST runs it.
 *
 * WHY beam-media owns it: beam-media requires spatie/laravel-medialibrary and defines the media traits
 * (HasPrimaryImages / HasFeaturedImage), so the media table is media-arm infrastructure — any beam install
 * that attaches media needs it, with or without the CMS publishing layer. Beam is UUID-native: every
 * media-owning model in the estate (publishing's Post, satellite models like AudioSample / Composition)
 * carries a UUID key. Spatie's default `$table->morphs('model')` makes `model_id` a BIGINT — which
 * silently "works" on SQLite's loose typing but throws `invalid input syntax for type bigint` on a
 * strict driver (Postgres) the moment a UUID owner attaches media. `uuidMorphs` is the spatie-blessed
 * fix for UUID owners and the honest expression of beam's UUID-native constraint.
 *
 * UBIQUITOUS table (central + every tenant): this same DDL ships as TWO copies — this flat one lands in
 * the host's `database/migrations/` (central pass) and its `tenant/` twin lands in
 * `database/migrations/tenant/` (Stancl tenant pass) — so `media` exists identically in the central
 * schema and every tenant schema (a tenant-scoped Post's featured image lives in the tenant schema; a
 * central model's media in the central schema). The `2026_06_30_000050` prefix lands it before
 * publishing's `posts`/`categories` — no ordering dependency, media just settles early.
