/**
 * Declarative primary-image slots on top of spatie/laravel-medialibrary. A model declares
 * its slots via {@see primaryImages()} — a map of slot (single-file collection) name to
 * config — and the trait drives collection + conversion registration and media-first URL
 * resolution.
 *
 * This is the substrate media affordance: it is deliberately domain-agnostic. It knows
 * nothing about TMDB, legacy path columns, or any particular slot name — it only turns a
 * declared slot map into registered single-file collections + conversions and resolves a
 * slot's URL through media library. A host that needs a legacy dual-read, an ingest-from-
 * source path, or a specific `featured`/`hero`/`og` slot layers that ON TOP by overriding
 * {@see primaryImages()} and/or composing a mixin (see {@see HasFeaturedImage} for the
 * common single-featured-image opt-in). beam names no domain package — the dependency runs
 * one way (host -> beam), never the reverse.
 *
 * The base default is an EMPTY slot map: a bare `use HasPrimaryImages` registers nothing
 * until the host declares slots. This is the abstract-default reconciliation — the method
 * is concrete (so a host may adopt the trait without being forced to implement it, and the
 * base machinery has a sensible no-op default) but fully overridable (so a host that wants
 * its own slots, abstract-style, simply overrides it). A host that historically declared
 * `primaryImages()` abstract can adopt this trait and keep overriding the method verbatim.
 *
 * Config shape per slot: `{ conversions?: array<string, int>, fallback?: string|null }`.
 * Hosts are free to carry extra keys (source/column/route/…) in the config for their own
 * overridden behavior; the base ignores everything but `conversions` and `fallback`.
