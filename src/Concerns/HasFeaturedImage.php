 * it contributes a `featured` slot (single-file collection with a `card` conversion) to the
 * primary-image map and adds `featured`-defaulted conveniences.
 *
 * It embeds {@see HasPrimaryImages} so a host uses a single `use HasFeaturedImage;` — the two
 * traits are not composed side-by-side (that would collide on `primaryImages()`). The base
 * machinery (collection/conversion registration, URL resolution) is inherited unchanged; only
 * the slot map is extended.
 *
 * Extending the map further stays open WITHOUT overriding `primaryImages()` and re-declaring
 * `featured`: a host overrides {@see additionalPrimaryImages()} to add `hero` / `og` / etc.,
 * and the `featured` slot is merged in automatically. (A host may still override
 * `primaryImages()` wholesale if it wants to drop or reshape `featured`.)
